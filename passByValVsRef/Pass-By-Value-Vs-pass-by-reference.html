                <p>Later or sooner, you will be asked, "Hey, Is this language is pass-by-value or pass-by-reference".</p>
                <p>Even after years, people reply something like, "It's pass by value......or wait a minute...it's pass by reference....Hey you know what, i read it some xyz blog, it's always be pass by value".</p>
                <p>Sometime, even though say pass by value, they mean pass by reference and vice-versa</p>
                <p>This article will help you to understand that.</p>

                <h3>So what is it?....pass by value or pass by reference?</h3>

                <p>In Javascript and Java, we have two types, primitive type and reference/Object type</p>
                <p>primitive type is easy, it always be pass by value, simple and clear. Hence we are not going to discuss that</p>
                <p>What about reference?</p>
                <p>For all theoretical reason(interview and test), just say <b>pass by value</b>
                </p>
                <p>However, for all practical reason, you have to go bit deeper, this article is all about that</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Believe me, above statement is not important, what important is to understand How this all work!</p>

                <p>Let's understand first, What actually happen when we create Object and reference.</p>
                <p>Let's go with example where you have a TV in your home, its far and not many button on it. To access it, you need a remote.</p>
                <p>A reference of Objcet is nothing but high-tech, re-configurable remote, which can point to your TV, but when re-configured, it can point to another TV, but at a time only one TV and TV is nothing but the Object, sitting deep down in Heap.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>

                <p><b>Step 1:</b> You create a TV(by calling new Object()), you configured this TV with remote1(by assigning Object to reference)
                    <p>At this stage, you can change the volume of TV by using remote (You can change the value of Object by reference)</p>
                    <img src="img1.png" />

                    <br>
                    <p>Step 2: Now You want a separate remote, you create a copy of it, at this time both remote has power to change the volume of TV, mind it none of the remote is a TV, breaking a remote will not affect TV(as assigning reference to null, will not change the object or assigned it to null)</p>
                    <img src="img2.png" />

                    <p>Step 3: because of some reason, you configured second remote to second TV (assigning remote2 reference to new TV Object)</p>
                    <p>At this stage relation of both remote are gone, Each can control there own TV but not of each others. if remote2 get destroyed(remote2 = null) and then TV2 get destroyed(2nd TV object get destroyed), remote1 and TV1 will stil work fine.</p>

                <br/>

                <p>Everything we discussed above, can be connected in code</p>
                <p>For simplicity, i have taken similar use case of TV, with a vol property.</p>
                <p>Both in Javascript and Java code, we are passing reference to other function/method and try to change the vol property.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h1>Javascript</h1>
                <br>




                <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">

/**
 * A simple Object/function, we call it TV, with property vol
 */
function TV(vol) {
    this.vol = vol;
}

var remote1 = new TV(10);
console.log("Initial test: ", remote1.vol);                 // Print 10
duplicate(remote1);
console.log("After Duplicate: ", remote1.vol);              //Print 20

/**
 * This is pass by value, but work like pass-by-reference i.e. whatever changes you will do here to remote2 will affet the main TV
 * i.e. remote1 will also reflect same.
 */
function duplicate(remote2) {
    remote2.vol = 20;
    console.log("In Duplicate: ", remote2.vol);             //Print 20
}

</pre>

                <p>See what happen when we assign another object to reference, it's lost all connection with initial Object</p>
                <p>Point to note, first reference(remote1) is still pointing to first Object and it's unchanged value</p>

                </h1>

                <p>For all technical reason(Interview and test), Javascript and java are <b>pass by value</b> language</p>
                <p>When we pass reference, for all practical reason, things behave like pass by reference because we pass the value of memory location ob Object in heap.</p>
                <p>Actually, calling reference pass "pass by value", sound wrong and give wrong signal, because traditionally pass by value does give you power to update Object which intern reflect in all reference.</p>
                <p>Calling reference pass "pass by reference", sounds more correct as it let you update the Object which intern reflect in all reference.</p>
                <p>With all these confusion best is, just know whats going on...and let technical jargon for Interview and test.</p>

                <p>Any one from C background, will ask you this one day</p>
                <p>Why??...because C started pass-by-value and pass-by-reference concept and It does it well</p>
                <p>It is clear in code when you are doing what and why you doing so.</p>
                <p>I tried to have similar code what we have seen so far in C (struct is closet o Object in C) and things are so clear here, we just spread confusion in all other modern languages.</p>
